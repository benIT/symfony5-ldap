## webpack encore

 we're going to use a Node library called Webpack: which is the industry-standard tool for managing your frontend assets. It combines and minifies your CSS and JavaScript files... though that's just the tip of the iceberg of what it can do.
 But... to get Webpack to work really well requires a lot of complex config. So, in the Symfony world, we use a wonderful library called Webpack Encore. It's a lightweight layer on top of Webpack that... makes it easier!
